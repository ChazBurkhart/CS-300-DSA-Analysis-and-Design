# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design


**_What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?_**

  In this course we were solving sorting and searching algorithms and how different data structures affected load times.


**_How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand._**

  Based on what we learn in the text, I followed their lead. Each data structure has its pros and cons. The data structure used depends on 
  the needs of the program. Speed, run times, and memory allocation are all important factors to consider for choosing a data structure.

**_How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?_**

  My biggest road block was setting up my IDE to correctly run the code. I fell behind fast when I was unable to compile my code and test it.
  Through a lot of searching online, I was able to get it at least partially running. Then later in the course, there was a walkthrough that
  showed how to correctly setup the Eclipse IDE and then it became vastly easier to run and test the code.

**_How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?_**

  Prior to this project and class, I only really knew about vectors and lists. Now I understand linked lists, hash tables, and binary search
  trees too.

**_How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?_**

  Prior to this project, I didn't know how to access and sort data structures. Now I can use hash tables or linked lists to sort and store
  data rather than just a list or vector.
